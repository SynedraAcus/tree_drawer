### Tree drawer
Tree visualisation code for a paper on intragenic duplications in diatoms.

#### Design

This script takes a Newick tree of domains and tries to highlight different
parts of the same multidomain sequence in the same color, thus facilitating the
manual search for matching clades. The sequences that cannot be matched, or
domains that form a pair of sister leaves (*ie* are not part of a larger clade)
are highlighted in dark gray. The sequences that are the only domain within
their respective sequences are not highlighted. Example tree is shown below:
